                <p>Sorry for the jank appearence but pls roll with it. I wrote this in python and it doesn't get along 
                with html, so in retrospect should've used js or java, but eh I wanted to learn python. But here's
                how to actually start playing:</p>
      
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to the seperator between the code and the console, and drag it up so you only see the console.</li>
                    <li>Click the play button on the bottom right</li>
                    <li>I don't have a third thing but I feel like you need at least 3 things to talk about if you're going to list them like this. </li>
                </ol>
